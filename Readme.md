This was a project done in my home university UPC with three other classmates.
This project consisted in the use of different patterns in software engineering.
It is programmed with **Java** using **Hibernate** as a **ORM**
It also contains a service, also self-made.
Notice that some comments, and name functions might be in Catalan.
